# Components

Which component to use, how Google says to use it, and the Expressive Compose API. Names and parameters were checked against androidx sources (material3 1.5.0-alpha28) in September 2026. Components marked (experimental) need `@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3ExpressiveApi::class)`.

## Selection guide

| Need | Component | Rules that matter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page title and 1 or 2 actions | App bar: search, small, medium flexible, large flexible | One action, two at most; boost the key one with a filled or tonal (optionally wide) icon button, never two filled; fills with a contrasting color on scroll, or stays transparent with filled icon buttons floating over content; flexible bars compress to small on scroll |
| Actions or toggles for the current page, even two or three | Toolbar: floating (contextual) or docked (global) | Standard colors keep focus on content, vibrant colors emphasize controls or signal a mode like editing; never with a navigation bar on screen; floating can pair with a FAB and collapse on scroll |
| The single most important action | FAB (FAB, medium, large) | One per screen; not every screen needs one; stays put on scroll; bottom half of the screen; color from primary, secondary, or tertiary sets |
| Labeled primary action on a long scroll | Extended FAB (small, medium, large) | One per screen; not inside a set of actions; not with a floating toolbar |
| 2 to 6 related actions behind the FAB | FAB menu | Only from a regular FAB; not with a toolbar or rail; color set matches the FAB |
| Discrete actions | Buttons: elevated, filled, tonal, outlined, text; XS to XL; round or square | Don't overuse; three at most in one arrangement; primary action gets more size, color, or shape |
| Related buttons that react together | Standard button group | Same size and shape by default; mixed sizes only for hero moments; different shape only for selection or meaning |
| Choose an option or a view mode within one screen | Connected button group | Items must be toggleable; one color style for the whole group |
| Main action plus alternatives | Split button | Menu aligned to the trailing half, 4dp away |
| Common icon actions | Icon buttons: filled, tonal, outlined, standard; XS 32 to XL 136dp; narrow, uniform, wide | Filled sparingly; equally important buttons share a size; outlined icon when off, filled when toggled on |
| Contextual choices, filters, entered items | Chips: assist, filter, input, suggestion | Never for Save or Cancel; always in a set; can scroll horizontally |
| Content about one topic | Cards: elevated, filled, outlined | Don't force content into cards when spacing or headings would do; container transform to detail only for hero moments; no internal scroll on phones |
| Visual collection | Carousel: multi-browse, uncontained, hero, centered hero, full-screen | Snap scrolling except uncontained; at most 3 items with text on phones; offer "Show all" |
| Scannable items | Expressive list, standard or segmented | Align leading visuals and text; gaps for contained lists, dividers only for uncontained ones; one selection mode at a time |
| Temporary set of actions | Vertical menu | Group with gaps or dividers; vibrant (tertiary) colors sparingly |
| 3 to 5 top destinations (phone) | Flexible navigation bar | Labels always; fewer than 3 destinations means tabs; no swiping between destinations; reselecting scrolls to top |
| Destinations on larger windows | Navigation rail, collapsed (3 to 7 items) or expanded | Leading edge, outside panes; one navigation component per screen; expanded replaces the drawer |
| Related content on one level | Tabs, primary and secondary | Not for sequential content; avoid swipeable content inside |
| Supplementary content | Bottom sheet (phones), side sheet (medium and up) | Drag handle cycles heights; scrim tap closes |
| Blocking decision | Dialog | Rare; low-priority messages go to a snackbar |
| Brief feedback | Snackbar | One at a time, one action, above the FAB and navigation |
| Wait of 200ms to 5s | Loading indicator | Under 200ms show nothing; over 5s use a progress indicator; one indicator per group |
| On/off setting | Switch | Takes effect immediately; not for opposing options (use a connected button group) |
| Pick one or several | Radio buttons (5 or fewer) or checkboxes | Vertical lists; one radio always selected |
| Value in a range | Slider: standard, centered, range | Takes effect immediately; no vertical range sliders |
| Text entry | Text field, filled or outlined | Don't mix the two in one form |
| Search | Search bar, search app bar (global), or search icon button | Group results with gaps; full screen on phones, docked on tablets |

## Component details

Usage rules from each component's Guidelines tab on m3.material.io (quotes are Google's). Read the section for every component you place.

### Choosing emphasis across buttons

- "Each screen should contain a single prominent button for the primary action." Emphasis order: FAB, then filled, tonal, elevated, outlined, text; icon buttons filled, tonal, outlined, standard.
- Filled: final or unblocking actions (Save, Confirm), "ideally for only one action on a page." Tonal: supporting actions that need a little more than an outline (Next in onboarding). Outlined: attention without being primary, or a way to change your mind. Text: "the lowest priority actions," inside cards, dialogs, and snackbars. Elevated: only to separate from a patterned background.
- Pair by stepping down: filled next to text or outlined; outlined next to text. Place buttons side by side when there's room, not stacked.
- "Don't clutter your UI with too many buttons. Consider presenting low-priority actions in overflow menus or as icon buttons."
- Labels 1 to 3 words, sentence case, never wrapped or truncated; the icon leads. Don't stretch buttons into long flat bars on large screens.
- Toggle buttons are for binary selections (Save, Favorite): outlined icon off, filled on, and the shape morphs, so selection shows through more than color.

### Icon buttons

- For common actions with "a system icon with a clear meaning." "Only use a few icon buttons at once"; in dense layouts group them in a toolbar or button group.
- Filled for a key action (sparingly), tonal for secondary actions beside a high-emphasis one (Raise hand next to a filled End call), outlined for medium emphasis, standard for low emphasis or colorful surfaces.
- "When buttons have a similar importance, they should be the same size." Use size and width (narrow, default, wide) for hierarchy.
- Toggle icon buttons only for things with a selected state, never for overflow.

### Button groups and split button

- Standard group: related buttons that react together. Same size and shape by default; "Only use multiple sizes in a group for hero moments." Use filled, tonal, outlined, or elevated buttons: standard icon and text buttons "have no container treatment."
- Connected group: select options, switch views, or sort; "Avoid using a connected group when none of the buttons can be toggled." One color style per group. Groups never wrap to a second line.
- Split button: one action plus a menu of related ones, labels of one or two words; the trailing half always shows the menu icon.

### FAB, extended FAB, FAB menu

- FAB for "the most important action on a screen," constructive (create, share, start), never minor or destructive; "FABs are not needed on every screen." Never disable it: hide it when unavailable.
- Medium FAB is the default on phones, large on tablets. Lower trailing corner on compact and medium windows; in the rail on expanded.
- Extended FAB: for long scrolling screens where a label helps; one per screen; never in the top half of a phone screen, on cards, or on toolbars; collapses to a FAB when scrolling down.
- FAB menu: 2 to 6 closely related actions from a regular FAB; not with a floating toolbar or navigation rail.

### App bars

- Title plus "1–2 essential actions"; "one action, two if necessary." The primary action alters or exits the page (Send, Save, Edit). Many actions go in a toolbar; avoid overflow in the app bar when possible.
- Boost the key action with one filled or tonal (optionally wide) icon button; "Don't put multiple filled or tonal buttons in the app bar." Prefer filled icons.
- Small for dense layouts or scrolled pages; medium flexible and large flexible emphasize the headline and compress to small on scroll. Titles start-aligned or centered, never truncated; wrap to two lines only in flexible bars.
- Straight corners; never shorter than the default height.

### Toolbars

- "Use a toolbar to provide actions related to the current page." Floating: "contextual actions relevant to the body content or the specific page." Docked: global actions that stay the same across pages. A small set counts (default): two or three page actions are enough for a toolbar.
- Standard colors focus attention on the content; vibrant is "a high-emphasis color scheme that draws attention to the controls" and can signal a temporary mode such as editing.
- Emphasize one action at most: a filled icon button, a different color role, a wide button, or a paired FAB. "Emphasize one action at a time."
- Floating toolbars: fully on screen (overflow menu for extras), 16dp from the edges, no extra padding, no square filled icon buttons, one per compact window. Never with a navigation bar.
- A floating toolbar can also be local navigation between related pages.

### Navigation bar and rail

- Bar: 3 to 5 top destinations on phones and small tablets; labels always, 1 or 2 words, never truncated; fixed positions; filled icon for the active item. Fewer than 3 destinations means tabs; never on desktop layouts. The FAB sits above the bar, never over it.
- Rail: medium windows and up, 3 to 7 destinations, leading edge, outside panes; "Never use the navigation rail and navigation bar simultaneously." The expanded rail replaces the navigation drawer (no longer recommended).

### Tabs

- "Tabs organize groups of related content that are at the same level of hierarchy"; never for sequential content. Primary tabs under the app bar, secondary tabs inside content.
- Avoid more than 4 fixed tabs; use scrollable tabs (first tab offset 52dp) when labels are long or many. Icons on all tabs or none.
- Tabs attached to an app bar move with it as one unit; avoid swipeable content inside tabbed pages.

### Cards and carousel

- A card holds content and actions on a single topic. "Don't force content into cards when spacing, headlines, or dividers would create a simpler visual hierarchy." At compact sizes, "consider swapping cards for lists."
- Elevated, filled, and outlined differ in style only. A card is either actionable itself or contains actions, never both. No internal scrolling or swipeable content inside a card.
- Carousel: visual items with brief text; snap scrolling except uncontained; at most three items with text on compact screens; buttons go above or below, never on or beside the carousel; offer "Show all."

### Dialogs and sheets

- Dialogs for "critical information that requires a specific user task, decision, or acknowledgement," used "sparingly"; low-priority messages go to a snackbar. At most two actions, confirm at the trailing edge; headlines never apologize or ask "Are you sure?"
- Full-screen dialogs only on compact windows, for multi-step or input-heavy tasks: close icon and a "Save" action.
- Bottom sheets hold supplementary content on phones; modal sheets replace long menus or simple dialogs. Side sheets hold optional content on medium windows and up and always show a close button.

### Chips

- Chips "represent forking paths for a current task, while buttons represent linear steps." Never use chips to finish or progress a task, and never show a single chip alone.
- Assist chips start with a verb; filter chips name what to include; input chips hold user entries; suggestion chips hold product suggestions. All chip sets on a page are either single-select or multi-select.
- Not elevated on the page; labels 20 characters or fewer; wrap or scroll horizontally in one row.

### Selection controls, sliders, text fields

- Checkboxes for multiple related options in a list; radio buttons for one of five or fewer, listed vertically, one always selected; switches for standalone settings that take effect immediately. Opposing options (list or map view) use a connected button group, not a switch. "A switch can't replace a button."
- Sliders take effect immediately and show the full range; "XL sliders should be reserved for hero moments, where the slider itself is the most important element on the page."
- Text fields always have a visible label that never truncates; filled and outlined differ by style only, but never both in one form. Error text replaces supporting text; fields never span the full width of a large screen.

### Feedback and status

- Loading indicator for waits of 200ms to 5s; nothing under 200ms; a progress indicator over 5s. One indicator for a group of items. Use the contained loading indicator over other content.
- The wavy progress shape "can make longer processes feel less static"; it adds height and suits moments "when a more expressive style is appropriate."
- Snackbar: one at a time, one action at most (an "Undo" is ideal), no icons or links, above the FAB and never over navigation.
- Tooltips label icon-only buttons; never hide critical information in one.
- Badges sit at the icon's upper trailing corner, error colors, at most four characters ("999+").
- Dividers: "Only use dividers if items can't be grouped with open space"; "use dividers to group things, not separate individual items."


### Lists

- Align leading visuals and primary text in the same position on every row; put visuals at the leading edge, never mid-row.
- People get circular or expressive-shape avatars (`MaterialShapes`); products and videos get square or rectangular images.
- An item with an image can take a content-based container color from that image, on its enabled state or on interaction.
- Supporting text: one to three lines. Trailing text for price, count, or date. Leading or trailing checkbox (multi-select), radio (single-select), or switch (settings).
- Primary action takes most of the row; secondary actions (bookmark, overflow) go trailing.
- Show selection with two cues, never color alone (a checkmark plus a fill).
- Swipe reveals mixed-style buttons with the primary action last; a full swipe triggers it; always offer another path (overflow).
- Settings rows with a switch: use the `onClick` overload of `SegmentedListItem` with a trailing `Switch(checked, onCheckedChange = null)` (clicking the row toggles it), and give the row `Modifier.semantics { role = Role.Switch; toggleableState = ToggleableState(checked) }` so TalkBack announces one switch instead of a button plus a switch. The `checked` overload gives the whole row a checkbox role and a selected fill.
- Segmented items must stand off their background: on a `surface` page, pass `colors = ListItemDefaults.segmentedColors(containerColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceContainerHigh)`.
- Compact: edge-to-edge list opening a full detail page. Medium and up: list-detail side by side; a list can become cards or a carousel on large screens.

### Menus

- A temporary set of actions; persistent actions belong in a toolbar.
- Unavailable items show disabled, not removed.
- Gaps group items more expressively than dividers: at most one or two gaps, fixed size, never in a scrolling menu (use dividers there).
- Slots (image, swatch, progress) only for simple content; never a button or switch inside an item.
- On compact screens, long or complex menus can become a bottom sheet; on larger screens, menus stay in context and can use submenus.
- The trigger keeps its look and shows a pressed state while the menu is open.

### Search

- Entry point by importance: search app bar when search is the product's main job, a search bar below the title for one view's content, a search icon button when secondary.
- Contained style: container `surfaceContainerHigh` on a `surface` background (never on `surfaceContainer`); 24dp margins unfocused, 12dp focused.
- Leading: a navigation icon button or a non-functional search icon. Trailing: at most two icons (voice, profile avatar, overflow).
- Hint text names what is searchable: "Search your messages," not "Search."
- Results and suggestions are lists: add leading icons, category labels (Recent, Contacts), avatars, filter chips, and gaps between groups.
- Full-screen results on compact, docked results on medium and up; keep the query visible after searching.

## Patterns from shipped Expressive apps

Recurring moves in Google's showcases and well-reviewed Expressive apps. Read them for examples after choosing the composition (SKILL.md section 8), not to choose it; use one only when it serves the screen's direction.

- **Metric card:** a small label over a huge emphasized number in a tinted container; the number is the hero, the label whispers.
- **Editorial header:** a Display or custom-width title that dominates the top of a screen or sits over a full-bleed photo (an album or trip cover).
- **Shape-masked media:** album art, avatars, and badges clipped to library shapes (Cookie, Flower, Sunny, Clover), sometimes clustered for groups.
- **Pill hero control:** a full-width pill primary action paired with smaller round secondary buttons (Play with skip; Pause with Stop and Restart). Toggles beside it (like, shuffle, repeat) can be standard, tonal, or filled as long as their state stays clear and the main action stays distinguishable.
- **Split action pair:** two large half-width pills in contrasting colors for a two-way decision (Snooze and Stop), or a wide pill beside a round button (Stop with Pause).
- **Floating pill toolbar** at the bottom holding the page's actions (or local navigation), with the active item as a filled pill.
- **Segmented settings:** grouped list items with gaps, leading icons in tonal circles, switches with check and close thumb icons (`Switch(thumbContent = ...)`).
- **Wavy progress** for playback and goals; circular wavy progress for countdowns.

## Icons

Use Material Symbols in one style (outlined, rounded, or sharp) across the app.

1. Download icons from [fonts.google.com/icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) in the Android format (vector drawable XML), with Fill 0 for the default state and Fill 1 for selected states.
2. Delete only the `android:tint="?attr/colorControlNormal"` attribute from each file's `<vector>` tag, keeping the tag's closing `>`; in Compose, `Icon` applies the color.
3. Draw with `Icon(painterResource(R.drawable.ic_favorite), contentDescription = "Like", tint = ...)`; leave `tint` at its default (`LocalContentColor`) inside components so the role pair stays correct.

`androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended` is the older Material Icons set, frozen at 1.7.8 and large; use it only for quick prototypes. Snippets below use `Icons.Rounded.*` for brevity.

## Snippets

### Flexible app bar

```kotlin
val scrollBehavior = TopAppBarDefaults.exitUntilCollapsedScrollBehavior()
Scaffold(
    modifier = Modifier.nestedScroll(scrollBehavior.nestedScrollConnection),
    topBar = {
        LargeFlexibleTopAppBar(
            title = { Text("Habits") },
            subtitle = { Text("3 left today") },
            navigationIcon = { /* back icon button */ },
            actions = {
                FilledTonalIconButton(onClick = onAdd, shapes = IconButtonDefaults.shapes()) {
                    Icon(Icons.Rounded.Add, contentDescription = "Add habit")
                }
            },
            scrollBehavior = scrollBehavior,
        )
    },
) { padding -> /* content */ }
```

### XL control-led hero button

```kotlin
val height = ButtonDefaults.ExtraLargeContainerHeight
Button(
    onClick = onStart,
    shapes = ButtonDefaults.shapesFor(height),
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth().heightIn(height),
    contentPadding = ButtonDefaults.contentPaddingFor(height),
) {
    Text("Start session", style = ButtonDefaults.textStyleFor(height))
}
```

### Floating toolbar with a FAB

```kotlin
Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    content()
    HorizontalFloatingToolbar(
        expanded = expanded,
        floatingActionButton = {
            FloatingToolbarDefaults.VibrantFloatingActionButton(onClick = onCompose) {
                Icon(Icons.Rounded.Edit, contentDescription = "Compose")
            }
        },
        colors = FloatingToolbarDefaults.vibrantFloatingToolbarColors(),
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.BottomEnd).offset(x = -FloatingToolbarDefaults.ScreenOffset, y = -FloatingToolbarDefaults.ScreenOffset),
    ) {
        IconButton(onClick = onArchive) { Icon(Icons.Rounded.Archive, contentDescription = "Archive") }
        IconButton(onClick = onLabel) { Icon(Icons.Rounded.Label, contentDescription = "Label") }
    }
}
```

Collapse on scroll by attaching `Modifier.floatingToolbarVerticalNestedScroll(expanded, onExpand = { expanded = true }, onCollapse = { expanded = false })` to the scrolling container.

### FAB menu

```kotlin
var open by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }
FloatingActionButtonMenu(
    expanded = open,
    button = {
        ToggleFloatingActionButton(checked = open, onCheckedChange = { open = it }) {
            val icon = if (checkedProgress > 0.5f) Icons.Rounded.Close else Icons.Rounded.Add
            Icon(icon, contentDescription = null, modifier = Modifier.animateIcon({ checkedProgress }))
        }
    },
) {
    FloatingActionButtonMenuItem(onClick = onPhoto, text = { Text("Photo") }, icon = { Icon(Icons.Rounded.PhotoCamera, null) })
    FloatingActionButtonMenuItem(onClick = onNote, text = { Text("Note") }, icon = { Icon(Icons.Rounded.Notes, null) })
}
```

### Connected button group

```kotlin
Row(horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(ButtonGroupDefaults.ConnectedSpaceBetween)) {
    options.forEachIndexed { index, label ->
        ToggleButton(
            checked = selected == index,
            onCheckedChange = { selected = index },
            shapes = when (index) {
                0 -> ButtonGroupDefaults.connectedLeadingButtonShapes()
                options.lastIndex -> ButtonGroupDefaults.connectedTrailingButtonShapes()
                else -> ButtonGroupDefaults.connectedMiddleButtonShapes()
            },
            modifier = Modifier.weight(1f).semantics { role = Role.RadioButton },
        ) { Text(label) }
    }
}
```

### Standard button group

```kotlin
ButtonGroup(overflowIndicator = { ButtonGroupDefaults.OverflowIndicator(it) }) {
    clickableItem(onClick = onPrevious, label = "Previous", icon = { Icon(Icons.Rounded.SkipPrevious, null) })
    toggleableItem(checked = playing, label = "Play", onCheckedChange = onPlayToggle, icon = { Icon(Icons.Rounded.PlayArrow, null) }, weight = 2f)
    clickableItem(onClick = onNext, label = "Next", icon = { Icon(Icons.Rounded.SkipNext, null) })
}
```

### Split button

```kotlin
SplitButtonLayout(
    leadingButton = { SplitButtonDefaults.LeadingButton(onClick = onSend) { Text("Send") } },
    trailingButton = {
        SplitButtonDefaults.TrailingButton(checked = menuOpen, onCheckedChange = { menuOpen = it }) {
            Icon(Icons.Rounded.KeyboardArrowDown, contentDescription = "More send options")
        }
    },
)
```

### Segmented list

```kotlin
Column(verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(ListItemDefaults.SegmentedGap)) {
    settings.forEachIndexed { index, setting ->
        SegmentedListItem(
            onClick = { onOpen(setting) },
            shapes = ListItemDefaults.segmentedShapes(index, settings.size),
            leadingContent = { Icon(setting.icon, null) },
            supportingContent = { Text(setting.summary) },
        ) { Text(setting.title) }
    }
}
```

Separate groups with a larger gap (16 to 24dp) between columns of segmented items.

### Grouped vertical menu

```kotlin
DropdownMenuPopup(expanded = open, onDismissRequest = { open = false }) {
    val groups = listOf(listOf("Rename", "Duplicate"), listOf("Delete"))
    groups.forEachIndexed { groupIndex, items ->
        DropdownMenuGroup(shapes = MenuDefaults.groupShape(groupIndex, groups.size)) {
            items.forEachIndexed { i, item ->
                DropdownMenuItem(
                    onClick = { onAction(item) },
                    text = { Text(item) },
                    shape = MenuDefaults.itemShape(i, items.size).shape,
                )
            }
        }
        if (groupIndex < groups.lastIndex) Spacer(Modifier.height(MenuDefaults.GroupSpacing))
    }
}
```

### Loading and progress

```kotlin
@OptIn(ExperimentalMaterial3ExpressiveApi::class)
@Composable
fun Loading() = Box(Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) { ContainedLoadingIndicator() }

LinearWavyProgressIndicator(progress = { playback.fraction }, modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth())
```

### Navigation by window size

```kotlin
NavigationSuiteScaffold(
    navigationItems = {
        destinations.forEach { dest ->
            NavigationSuiteItem(
                selected = dest == current,
                onClick = { onNavigate(dest) },
                icon = { Icon(dest.icon, contentDescription = null) },
                label = { Text(dest.label) },
            )
        }
    },
) { /* current destination */ }
```

Use the `navigationItems` + `NavigationSuiteItem` overload (from `material3-adaptive-navigation-suite`, same 1.5.0 versions) rather than the older `navigationSuiteItems` scope overload. For explicit control, use `ShortNavigationBar` on compact and `WideNavigationRail` on medium and up.
